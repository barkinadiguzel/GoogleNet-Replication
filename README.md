# GoogleNet-Replication
GoogleNet-Replication replicates the Inception architecture, stacking Inception modules to capture multi-scale features efficiently. It includes auxiliary classifiers for improved gradient flow and uses dimension reduction with 1×1 convolutions to control computational cost.
